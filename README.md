# Driver-Speed-Distance-Using-K-Means-Clustering

## Project Overview
This project applies **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to analyze driver behavior based on their **speed** and **distance** features. By clustering drivers into distinct groups, we can better understand driving patterns, evaluate safety risks, and identify outliers.

##  Features
-  **Data Preprocessing** – Cleans missing values and prepares the dataset.
-  **Feature Scaling** – Uses `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features.
-  **K-Means Clustering** – Groups drivers into clusters based on speed and distance.
-  **Model Evaluation**:
  - Accuracy score
  - Classification report
  - Confusion matrix
-  **Data Visualization** – Plots driver clusters and centroids for better interpretation.
